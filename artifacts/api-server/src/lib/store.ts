# What Is a Pip?

A **pip** (percentage in point) is the smallest price increment in forex. For most pairs, one pip = 0.0001.

## Example
- EUR/USD at 1.0850 → moves to 1.0851 = **one pip move**
- JPY pairs: one pip = 0.01 (because JPY has fewer decimal places)

## Why It Matters
- Pips measure profit/loss on trades
- Help calculate risk per trade
- Define stop-loss and take-profit levels

# Understanding Lots

A **lot** is the standard unit of trading volume. One standard lot = 100,000 units of the base currency.

## Lot Types
- **Standard lot**: 100,000 units
- **Mini lot**: 10,000 units
- **Micro lot**: 1,000 units

## Profit Calculation
- 1 pip on a standard lot (EUR/USD) ≈ $10
- 1 pip on a mini lot ≈ $1
- 1 pip on a micro lot ≈ $0.10

## Getting Started
Most traders start with micro or mini lots to manage risk.

# Bid, Ask, and Spreads

When you see a price like **1.0850 / 1.0852**, this is:
- **Bid price (1.0850)**: what your broker will BUY from you
- **Ask price (1.0852)**: what your broker will SELL to you
- **Spread (2 pips)**: the difference = your trading cost

## What You Pay
If you buy at 1.0852 and sell at 1.0852:
- You still lose 2 pips immediately to the spread
- Favorable moves must exceed the spread to become profitable

## Spread Types
- **Fixed spread**: stays the same (good for planning)
- **Variable spread**: widens during news/volatility (common)

# Reading a Currency Quote

A complete forex quote looks like:

**EUR/USD 1.0850 / 1.0852 +0.12% (volume: 500k)**

Breaking it down:
- **EUR/USD**: base/quote pair (selling EUR, buying USD)
- **1.0850**: bid (sell price)
- **1.0852**: ask (buy price)
- **+0.12%**: daily change
- **volume**: trading activity

## Trading Example
You buy EUR/USD at 1.0852 (ask).
- You OWN 100k EUR
- You OWE 108,520 USD
- When EUR strengthens, you profit

## Quick Check
Always verify your quote direction before trading!

# Market vs Limit Orders

## Market Order
- Executes **immediately** at the current market price
- You get filled but price isn't guaranteed
- Use when speed matters more than exact price

### Example
EUR/USD ask is 1.0852 → you send a market BUY → you get filled at ~1.0852 (or close)

## Limit Order
- Executes only at a specified price or better
- May not fill if the price never reaches your level
- Use when you want price control

### Example
EUR/USD bid is 1.0850, but you want to BUY lower → place limit at 1.0840 → waits until price drops there

## When to Use
- **Market**: entering a trend you don't want to miss
- **Limit**: entering a support level or scaling in

# Stop-Loss Explained

A **stop-loss** is an automatic sell order that closes your position if the price moves against you too far.

## Example
- You BUY EUR/USD at 1.0852
- You set stop-loss at 1.0820 (32 pips down)
- If price hits 1.0820, you're automatically sold out
- Max loss: 32 pips × lot size

## Why It's Critical
- Protects you from catastrophic losses
- Removes emotion (trade closes automatically)
- Lets you sleep knowing your downside is limited

## Common Mistakes
- Setting it too tight (random noise stops you out)
- Not using one at all (dangerous!)
- Moving it after losses (revenge trading)

**Professional traders use stop-loss on EVERY trade.**

# Take-Profit and Target Levels

A **take-profit** is an automatic sell order that closes your position when you've made your desired profit.

## Example
- You BUY EUR/USD at 1.0852
- You set take-profit at 1.0880 (28 pips up)
- If price hits 1.0880, you're automatically closed
- Max profit: 28 pips × lot size

## Risk vs Reward
A good trade has a ratio like **1:2**:
- Risk 10 pips (stop-loss)
- Target 20 pips profit (take-profit)
- If you're right 50% of the time, you still profit long-term

## Set Before Entering
The best traders decide their target BEFORE opening a trade, not after.

# Position Sizing 101

The **2% rule**: Never risk more than 2% of your account on a single trade.

## Example
- Your account: $10,000
- Max risk per trade: 2% = $200
- If stop-loss is 20 pips away:
  - At 1 pip = $10 (for standard lot), you need micro lots
  - Exactly 2 micro lots = $20 per pip × 10 pips = $200 risk

## The Math
**Position Size = (Account Risk ÷ Pip Distance) ÷ Pip Value**

## Why 2%?
- Sustainable over 100s of trades
- A losing streak of 10 trades = 20% drawdown (recoverable)
- Allows you to stay in the game long-term

**Discipline with position size separates pros from blowups.**

# Understanding Leverage

**Leverage** lets you control a large position with a small deposit.

## Example
- Leverage 100:1 with $1,000 = control $100,000
- Price moves 1% = you make/lose $1,000 (100% of account)
- Easy to blow up

## Real-World Math
- 1% price move on $100k position = $1,000 P&L
- On a $1,000 account with 100:1 leverage = **100% account move**
- This is why beginners lose fast

## Safer Approach
- Start with 10:1 leverage (or even 1:1)
- Increase ONLY after 6 months of profitability
- High leverage + emotion = liquidation

**Respect leverage or it will end your trading career.**

# Margin: Don't Get Liquidated

**Margin** is the broker's money you're borrowing to trade. If your account value falls, the broker can force-close positions.

## Margin Levels
- **Used margin**: money tied up in open positions
- **Free margin**: money available to open new positions
- **Margin level (%)**: Free Margin ÷ Used Margin

## Liquidation
- When margin level falls below 25%, brokers close positions
- You get **liquidated** = all positions closed at market
- You lose most/all of your money

## Example
- Account: $1,000 with 100:1 leverage
- Open trade: $100,000 position
- Price moves 1% against you: -$1,000
- Your account = $0 → **liquidated**

# Trading Psychology

The market will test your emotions. Winners manage theirs.

## Common Emotional Mistakes
1. **Revenge trading**: losing a trade, then trading too big to recover quickly
2. **FOMO**: entering trades because others are, not because your setup is valid
3. **Holding losses**: hoping a losing trade will reverse instead of cutting losses
4. **Moving stops**: changing your stop-loss after opening (almost always wrong)

## Mental Discipline
- Stick to your plan: if stop-loss should be here, keep it here
- Pre-decide your targets: don't move them based on feelings
- Take breaks after 2 consecutive losses: your mindset is compromised
- Review losses without judgment: what did the market teach you?

## Winning Traders
- Follow rules mechanically
- Accept small losses as cost of business
- Let winners run but cut losers fast
- Trade the same size consistently
